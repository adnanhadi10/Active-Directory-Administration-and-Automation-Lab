## Active Directory Administration and Automation Lab

### Description
This project focuses on building an **Active Directory** and **Windows network administration** environment using **PowerShell automation**, **Remote Access Server (RAS)** configuration, and **Windows Server** management. Deploying and managing this lab environment strengthens understanding of Active Directory operations and Windows networking principles.

PowerShell scripts are developed and executed to automate the **provisioning, maintenance, and deprovisioning** of user accounts within Active Directory, improving efficiency in identity and account lifecycle processes.

The **RAS** role is configured to support **Network Address Translation (NAT)** and **Port Address Translation (PAT)**, enabling secure and efficient remote access for network connectivity.

In addition, **Windows DNS** and **DHCP** services are administered to provide reliable, automated network addressing. **Windows File Servers** are configured with **quotas** and **NTFS permissions** to maintain secure, organized, and controlled file storage.

This lab demonstrates critical network administration tasks and automation practices, providing hands-on experience with managing **Active Directory** and **Windows networking** environments.
